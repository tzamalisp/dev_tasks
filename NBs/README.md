   - [Description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) 
     of the `UCI HAR Dataset` with the relevant publications.
   - Tutorial 01: https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-models-for-human-activity-recognition-time-series-classification/
  
Inside the `datasets` directory, unzip the `UCI HAR Dataset.zip` file. Then, you can run the 
`har_1D_CNNs.py` script to see how the Neural Network works.
