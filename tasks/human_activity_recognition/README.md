# Human Activity Recognition

Here are the various tutorials this task is based to:
   - [1D Convolutional Neural Network Models for Human Activity Recognition](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-models-for-human-activity-recognition-time-series-classification/) 
   -
  
Inside the `datasets` directory, unzip the `UCI HAR Dataset.zip` file. Then, you can run the 
`har_main.py` script to see how the Neural Network works.

Rename the `config.yaml.sample` to `config.yaml` in order the task read the relevant build configurations.
