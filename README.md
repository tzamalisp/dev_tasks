Run `python har.py` to execute this task. For more information check the `README` file inside the
`human_activity_recognition` directory.

## Configuration

Inside the `project_configuration` directory, change the `config.yaml.sample` to `config.yaml`
and set the appropriate personal configurations for the relevant task.

## Bash Scripting

### Download all the remote branches from GitHub locally at once

Download the `get_all_branches.sh` to the repository you want to download all the
remote GitHub branches.

Then, in the terminal, run:
1) `chmod +x get_all_branches.sh`
2) `sh get_all_branches.sh`

Check the result at the local repository to show all the branches by running:

`git branch -a`
